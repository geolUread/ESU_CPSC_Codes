This was a group project. Me and one other person was in charge of the display area. 
We had to display the front and back images of the card and onto the main display area. 
This is one part of a larger project which is the implementation of the Solitaire Game.
This was done in the language C++.
Make sure Solution Platforms is set to Win32 in Visual Studio before running SolitaireView_IntegrationTest.
